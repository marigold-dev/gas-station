# Welcome on Gas Station

## Introduction

The Gas Station is a tool allowing developers to sponsor the transactions of their users. It can be
used to facilitate user onboarding, or to implement a specific economic model (e.g., users can
mint a NFT freely, but pay a fee when reselling it) which does not need the user to possess tez.

The Gas Station would typically be used by video game developers to subsidize activities for
users. It does not require these users to do any transaction or reveal their account, as the Gas
Station account independently processes those transactions. However, it's important to note that
this workflow may necessitate the use of specific smart contract patterns, such as permit (TZIP 17).

Currently, the API URL for Ghostnet is:
[https://ghostnet.gas-station-api.marigold.dev](https://ghostnet.gas-station-api.marigold.dev). The
Gas Station is not yet available on the Mainnet.
