# Welcome on Gas Station

## Introduction

The Gas Station is a tool designed for developers aiming to provide sponsored transactions to their users. It can be used to facilitate user onboarding or implementing a specific economic model (e.g., the user can mint a NFT freely, but pays a fee when reselling it).

The Gas Station would typically be used by video game developers seeking to subsidize activities for users without any tez in their wallets. It does not require these users to do any transaction or reveal their account, as the Gas Station account independently processes those transactions. However, it's important to note that this workflow may necessitate the use of specific smart contract patterns, such as permit (TZIP 17).

Currently, the API URL for Ghostnet is: [https://ghostnet.gas-station-api.marigold.dev](https://ghostnet.gas-station-api.marigold.dev). The Gas Station is not yet available on the Mainnet.
