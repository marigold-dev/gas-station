# Welcome on Gas Station

## Introduction

 The Gas Station is a tool for developers who want to offer feeless transactions to their users. It can be used to facilitate user onboarding, or with a specific economic model in mind (e.g., the user can mint a NFT freely, but pays a fee when reselling it).

The gas station would typically be used by video game developers who want to subsidize activity for users who do not own have any tez in their wallet. It does not require these users to do any transaction or reveal their account, as the gas station account posts those transactions itself. However, this workflow may require the use of specific smart contracts patterns, such as permit (TZIP 17).
